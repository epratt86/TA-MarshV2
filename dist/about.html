          <p><span class="bigger">We specialize in re-roofing, repairs of all types and sheet metal roof systems.</span>
            TA Marsh Roofing is a roofing company which has been operating in San Diego, CA for the last 36 years. We
            specialize in roof repairs and sheet metal roofing. Throughout our years in business, we have built
            professional standards of work. You don’t think about a new roof or repairing the old until you have a leak
            or damage. Roof repairs are something common in our daily work. If the time to fix your roof has come,
            don’t hesitate to contact TA Marsh Roofing. Our work includes inspecting your roof for leaks, weak areas
            and broken shingles and roof repairs. You will save more money if you call a professional roofer, instead
            of trying to fix your roof by yourself. Unprofessional roof repairs may cause more damage to your roof and
            that will cost more money for sure.</p>
