          <p><strong>Always a pleasure working with TA Marsh Roofing</strong>
            <p>
              <p>"Our office has had the opportunity of working with TA Marsh Roofing over the past 20 years. Their
                expertise in the roofing and construction industries, along with the quality of their litigation expert
                services has been an invaluable asset to our consulting team. It is always a pleasure working with TA
                Marsh Roofing and their staff and we look forward to continuing our mutually beneficial working
                relationship."</p>

              <p><strong>A valuable member of the consulting team</strong>
                <p>
                  <p>"My firm and I have worked with TA Marsh Roofing for over 23 years. Collaborations have ranged
                    from our involvement as the architects on reconstruction projects installed by TA Marsh Roofing to
                    consultants for litigation - as team members or in adversarial positions. Capabilities in the
                    roofing and construction industries and skill as litigation experts have made TA Marsh a valuable
                    member of the consulting team in either of those functions. I would recommend their services to
                    anyone in need of roofing or consulting services."</p>

                      <p><strong>Left the construction areas clean and safe</strong>
                        <p>
                          <p>"TA Marsh Roofing has provided a large range of roofing services for the Julian Union
                            School Districts for over 26 years. They have provided assistance to our architects as far
                            as optional products, specifications and detailed information for our roofing and
                            construction needs. Each time TA Marsh Roofing has executed their work without disruption
                            to the students or our curriculum and the finished product has been of the highest quality.
                            TA Marsh Roofing's crews always left the construction areas clean and safe for the children
                            and staff during construction. Their work was completed on time and has always exceeded our
                            expectations. Additionally, when needed for emergency repairs, Tim and his crew have
                            responded immediately. Thanks Tim and Greg for all your hard work and continued
                            assistance."</p>
